# HeartLens

Flutter project aimed at helping people identify heart arrythmias all at home, using phone camera based photoplethysmography and machine learning.

This repository is the **mobile app** component of the HeartLens project. Only patient accounts can sign in and upload their data to the cloud using this app. Doctors and admins can interact with user accounts and view respective data through the [doctor/admin portal website](https://github.com/00raymond/heartlensPortal).

## How to run it?

First, make sure Flutter framework is installed correctly on your pc. A guide on how to install can be found [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Make sure it's running correct using ```flutter doctor```, this will help verify the setup.

After receiving dependencies using ```flutter pub get```, this project can be ran using ```flutter run``` in the terminal in the root directory, with different cross-platform options to run. I strongly suggest using an iPhone or Android emulator, or better an actual device.

## Where can I see it in action?

A video demonstrating the full capabilities of the app can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2rrfsugdok&ab_channel=RaymondHouse).
