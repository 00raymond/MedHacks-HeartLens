# HeartLens

Flutter project aimed at helping people identify heart arrythmias all at home, using phone camera based photoplethysmography and machine learning.

## How to run it?

First, make sure Flutter framework is installed correctly on your pc. A guide on how to install can be found [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Make sure it's running correct using ```flutter doctor```, this will help verify the setup.

After receiving dependencies using ```flutter pub get```, this project can be ran using ```flutter run``` in the terminal in the root directory, with different cross-platform options to run. I strongly suggest using an iPhone or Android emulator, or better an actual device.

## Where can I see it in action?

A video demonstrating the full capabilities of the app can be found [here]().
